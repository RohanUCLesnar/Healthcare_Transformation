# Healthcare_Transformation
Developed an analytics-driven healthcare transformation framework focused on patient triage, hospital admissions forecasting, and chronic disease prediction, using real-world datasets and machine learning techniques.


Analysed hospital admission data to classify Emergency vs OPD cases using Logistic Regression and forecast short-term admission volumes using Random Forest, achieving classification accuracy of ~81% and improved admission forecasting reliability.

Performed EDA, feature engineering, and preprocessing (encoding, scaling, correlation analysis) in Python to support robust model development across multiple healthcare use cases.

Built predictive models for chronic diseases (Diabetes, Kidney, Heart) using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, KNN, Logistic Regression, LDA/QDA, achieving model accuracies exceeding 85–95% depending on condition.

Applied deep learning techniques (CNNs, ANN, EfficientNet-B3) for image-based cancer detection (Colon, Leukemia, Breast, Prostate, Lung), evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Developed comparative model evaluation frameworks to assess trade-offs between interpretability, precision, and recall for clinical decision support.

Translated analytical outputs into stakeholder-friendly insights, outlining next-step recommendations for pilot deployment, bias mitigation, and scalability within the Irish healthcare system.
